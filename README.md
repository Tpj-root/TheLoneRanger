*quotes from *The Lone Ranger (2013)*:

1. **Tonto**:
   *"Never take off the mask."*

2. **John Reid / The Lone Ranger**:
   *"If we ride together, we ride for justice."*

3. **Tonto**:
   *"Justice is what I seek, not revenge."*

4. **Latham Cole**:
   *"People want to believe. They want a show."*

5. **The Lone Ranger**:
   *"Hi-yo, Silver! Away!"*
   *(Tonto responds: "Don’t ever do that again.")*


6. **Tonto**:
   *"There come a time, kemosabe, when good man must wear mask."*

7. **The Lone Ranger** (John Reid):
   *"I fight for justice, not vengeance."*

8. **Tonto**:
   *"Horse says you are spirit walker — a man who has been to the other side and returned."*

9. **John Reid**:
   *"This is wrong, Tonto. We can't just kill them."*
   **Tonto**: *"Horse says different."*

10. **Tonto**:
    *"You lost your shadow, kemosabe."*

11. **The Lone Ranger**:
    *"I am a lawman, Tonto. I believe in the system."*

12. **Tonto** (to The Lone Ranger):
    *"You are not a warrior."*





> **Tonto**: *“There come a time, kemosabe, when good man must wear mask.”*

It means: Sometimes, to fight injustice, good people must take bold, unexpected action — even if it means changing who they appear to be.



In *The Lone Ranger*, the **mask** has

1. **Symbol of justice** – Hides identity to fight crime without personal gain.
2. **Protection** – Keeps enemies from targeting him or loved ones.
3. **Rebirth** – John Reid “dies” and becomes the Lone Ranger — the mask marks his new purpose.
4. **Legend** – A masked man becomes a symbol that people remember and fear.

It's not just to hide — it’s to **stand for something greater**.





The quote **“Dead man strike fear into heart of his enemy”** :

– If enemies believe you are **dead**, they won’t expect you to return.
– So when you do, it’s like a **ghost** coming back — shocking and terrifying.
– It gives you an advantage, because they **fear what they don’t understand**.

Tonto says this to explain why the Lone Ranger should stay “dead” and wear the mask — to become **more powerful as a legend**.



– **Enemy doesn’t know** who you are behind the mask.
– They think you're **dead**, so your return **confuses and scares them**.
– You become like a **ghost or legend**, not just a man — harder to fight.
– That **fear and mystery** gives you power.

That’s why Tonto says: *“Dead man strike fear...”* — it's strategy.



**Lone Ranger** :

– A **hero** who fights for justice **alone** or without backup.
– "Ranger" = Lawman or protector.
– "Lone" = Working solo, outside the system.

In the movie, **John Reid** becomes *The Lone Ranger* after surviving an ambush and choosing to fight evil **his own way**, with only Tonto beside him.





**Kemosabe** :

– **"Trusted friend"** or **"faithful companion"**.
– Tonto calls the Lone Ranger this as a sign of respect.

It comes from old radio shows and may be based on a Native American or made-up word. In the film, it shows their **bond and loyalty**.
